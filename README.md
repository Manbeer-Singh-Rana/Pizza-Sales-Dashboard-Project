Project Overview
The Pizza Sales Project is aimed at creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze, track, and optimize the performance of a pizza business. The dashboard will provide insights into sales trends, customer preferences, operational efficiency, and profitability. This tool can be used by pizzeria owners, managers, or franchise operators to make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and boost revenue.

Objectives
Sales Tracking: Monitor daily, weekly, and monthly sales to identify patterns and trends.
Customer Preferences: Analyze pizza types, toppings, and sizes to determine whatâ€™s most popular among customers.
Operational Efficiency: Track inventory, delivery times, and staff performance to optimize operations.
Profitability Analysis: Evaluate profit margins, costs of ingredients, and overall profitability of different pizzas or locations.
Marketing Insights: Assess the effectiveness of promotions and marketing campaigns on sales.

Dashboard Features
Sales Overview: Displays total sales over different time periods (day, week, month, year) and breaks it down by pizza type, size, and toppings. Users can filter sales data based on specific days or pizza categories.

Customer Preferences: Visualizes data on the most popular pizzas, combinations, and toppings. It helps identify the best-selling items and provides insights into customer preferences based on order history.

Peak Sales Time Analysis: Identifies peak hours of operation and busiest times of the week. This can be used to optimize staffing levels and ensure the kitchen and delivery teams are prepared during high-demand periods.

Operational Efficiency Monitoring: Tracks the average time taken to prepare and deliver pizzas, as well as inventory levels. The dashboard can send alerts when inventory is low, allowing for proactive restocking.

Profitability Analysis: Shows the profit margins of different pizzas by comparing sales revenue to the cost of ingredients. This helps business owners identify which pizzas are most profitable and which ones may need adjustments (e.g., price increases or changes to the recipe).

Marketing and Promotions: Tracks the performance of promotions, discounts, or special events, providing insights into whether these campaigns are increasing sales and attracting more customers.

Data Sources
Point of Sale (POS) System: Sales data, customer orders, and payment information collected from the POS system.
Inventory Management System: Data on stock levels, usage rates, and waste of ingredients.
Customer Database: Information on customer preferences, demographics, and order history.
Delivery Systems: Data from third-party delivery apps (e.g., UberEats, DoorDash) or in-house delivery systems for tracking delivery times and sales by channel.
Marketing Campaigns: Data from promotional campaigns, coupons, or loyalty programs to track their impact on sales.
Technology Stack
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard with visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and KPIs.
SQL Database/Excel: For storing and importing sales, inventory, and customer data.
DAX & Power Query: For data transformation, modeling, and calculations to ensure accurate insights.
POS System Integration: Direct connection to POS systems or delivery platforms to pull real-time sales and customer data.
Project Workflow
Data Collection: Gather historical sales data, customer preferences, and inventory data from the POS system and delivery channels.
Data Cleansing: Clean and organize the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Remove duplicates or incorrect entries to make the data analysis-ready.
Data Modeling: Build relationships between sales data, inventory data, and customer preferences. Ensure that the data model is designed to track performance across all relevant metrics.
Dashboard Design: Create visualizations in Power BI to present the key metrics (e.g., sales performance, customer preferences, profitability). Ensure interactivity, allowing users to filter data by time period, pizza type, and more.
Deployment and Testing: Deploy the dashboard to Power BI Service and test for accuracy, performance, and usability. Ensure that it is accessible across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
Training and Handover: Provide training to the pizzeria's staff and management team so they can effectively use the dashboard for decision-making.
Ongoing Monitoring: Update the dashboard regularly with new data, and make adjustments based on feedback from users or changes in business needs.
Benefits
Enhanced Decision-Making: The dashboard provides real-time insights into sales, customer preferences, and profitability, allowing managers to make data-driven decisions.
Improved Customer Experience: By identifying peak sales times and customer preferences, the business can tailor its offerings and optimize its service to meet demand.
Increased Efficiency: The business can optimize inventory management and staffing by understanding peak demand times and operational bottlenecks.
Maximized Profitability: By analyzing the cost of ingredients versus revenue, the pizzeria can focus on promoting its most profitable pizzas and adjusting prices for lower-margin items.
